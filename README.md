# instagram_user_analytics
The project focused on analyzing Instagram user data to understand various aspects of user behavior, engagement metrics, and content performance. The goal was to derive actionable insights that could help in optimizing content strategies, increasing follower engagement, and improving overall social media presence
The project aims to analyze user interactions and engagement on Instagram using SQL to extract meaningful insights. 
These insights will help the marketing, product, and development teams to make decisions.
 In this project I used SQL queries to analyze the data, focusing on marketing analysis and investor metrics. 
Started with databased creation in MySQL.
Created tables in database to load raw data in respective tables.
Worked on Marketing analysis based on Loyal User Reward, Inactive User Engagement, Contest Winner Declaration, Hashtag Research, Ad Campaign Launch and Investor Metrics based on User Engagement, Bots & Fake Accounts
